Technically this module has no before as we setup the project during this module, but I added a before as we add stuff to the project part way through. The after code contains the source code, but you will still need to install the database as we do in the course. The source contained in the after folder should be copied into a folder in your workspace directory under a folder named ride_tracker. From there, you can import the project as an existing maven project inside your IDE.
