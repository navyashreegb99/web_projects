The setup for the before is just a matter of importing this project into your ide workspace. 

The setup for the after contains the source code as well as the database export. I have included flyway, a maven plugin to do database migrations, into the project. You may need to change the settings in the pom.xml to relect your usename and password for your database. You can then run mvn flyway:migrate from the root of your project on the command line and it should bring your database up to the version that we are at in the course. This does assume that you have mysql installed previously.
